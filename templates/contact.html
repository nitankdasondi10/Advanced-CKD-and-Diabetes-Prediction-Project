        <h2 class="mb-4">Urban-Rural Healthcare Disparities</h2>
        <p>Physical access to hospitals remains one of the most persistent barriers in Indiaâ€™s healthcare system. This is especially critical in rural areas, where nearly 70% of the population resides but medical infrastructure is limited.</p>
        <p>Rural communities often face challenges such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Long distances to the nearest hospital or diagnostic center</li>
            <li>Limited transportation options</li>
            <li>Shortage of healthcare professionals</li>
            <li>Lower awareness of preventive health measures</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="mb-4">How Our Platform Helps</h2>
        <p>Our web-based medical platform is designed to bring diagnostic tools and predictive healthcare models to the doorsteps of those living in remote and underserved areas.</p>
        <p>By using our system, rural patients can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Receive early predictions for chronic diseases like diabetes and kidney disease</li>
            <li>Understand their risk levels based on symptoms and health indicators</li>
            <li>Get recommendations for when to seek in-person medical consultation</li>
            <li>Access health insights without the burden of travel</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This empowers individuals and reduces the strain on urban hospitals by promoting timely diagnosis and decentralizing access to healthcare.</p>
